        type to something more suitable and this will re-organise the music display</string>

        that will select a single \'run through\' of the list of an infinite repeat until the user intervenes. The bar at the bottom has been modified to re-use
        the icons from the previous screen to keep some consistancy while changing due to the different screen layout.</string>
